### NOTES

*  _timeout_

    The default execution timeout for tasks is 10 minutes.
    
    Now it's not possible to change the timeout via API.

    To modify the timeout for a task use the Web Interface.

-----

## Running tasks

For a **Task** to run, internally, a new **Job** is created and added to the queue. If you want to run a **task** you only need to create a **Job** manually and supply the task ID \(and task options\) you want to run.

Note that in this example we are executing a task with no arguments, task_arguments is an empty array.
To execute a task with arguments, provide the list of ordered arguments in the "task_arguments" parameter.
Each argument must be a valid JSON escaped string.

This is easily done with a POST request to the Job endpoint API.

There are two methods available.

### Task and Workflow execution payload via API

When creating Task Jobs via API you will have to provide the Task ID and the Task Arguments.

```javascript
{
  // (required)
  task: "task id",
  // (required only if task has arguments)
  task_arguments: []
}
```

### Using task secret key. Integration Feature \(recommended\)

All tasks and workflows have a **secret key** which can be used to invoke them directly via API.
The secret key provides access to the task it belongs **and only to that task**.
**Secret keys** can be revoked any time by just changing them, which makes this the preferred method for it's implicity and security.

## Examples


### **Example 1**
### Get all

*Resquest*

```bash
customer=$THEEYE_ORGANIZATION_NAME

curl -sS "https://supervisor.theeye.io/${customer}/task?access_token=$THEEYE_TOKEN"
```

### **Example 2**
### Get by id

*Request*

```bash
customer=$THEEYE_ORGANIZATION_NAME
task_id=$(echo $THEEYE_JOB | jq -r '.task_id')
echo "task id: ${task_id}"

result=$(curl -sS "https://supervisor.theeye.io/${customer}/task/${task_id}?access_token=${THEEYE_TOKEN}")

echo $result | jq -c '. | {"name": .name, "id": .id, "hostname": .hostname}'
```

*Response*

Returns a json array with tasks, id and hostname:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "Get IP Address",
    "id": "5b1c65ee3c32bb1100c2920a",
    "hostname": "Apache3"
  },
  {
    "name": "Get IP Address",
    "id": "5b1c65ee3c32bb1100c29210",
    "hostname": "Apache1"
  },
  {
    "name": "Get IP Address",
    "id": "5b1c65efd421031000213bb8",
    "hostname": "Apache4"
  },
  {
    "name": "Get IP Address",
    "id": "5b1c65efd421031000213bc6",
    "hostname": "Apache2"
  }
]
```

### **Example 3**
### List and timeout

(Timeout = null) means that the timeout is set to default (10 minutes).

```bash
#!/bin/bash

customer=$1
access_token=$THEEYE_TOKEN
supervisor=$2
if [ $2 == "" ]; then supervisor='https://supervisor.theeye.io' ; fi
if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then echo "missing parameters" ; exit ; fi

data=$(curl -s ${supervisor}/${customer}/task?access_token=${access_token})

echo "${data}" | jq -j '.[] | "id: ", .id, "\ttask: ", .name, "\ttimeout: ", .timeout, "\n"'
```


### **Example 4**
### Execute using secret key

```bash
task_id=$TASK_ID
task_secret_key=$TASK_SECRET
customer=$(echo $THEEYE_ORGANIZATION_NAME | jq -r '.')

curl -i -sS \
  --request POST \
  --header "Accept: application/json" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-urlencode "customer = ${customer}" \
  --data-urlencode "task = ${task_id}" \
  --url "https://supervisor.theeye.io/job/secret/${task_secret_key}"
```

### **Example 5**
### HTML Button

This technique could be combined with an HTML form to generate an action button.
This is very handy when it is needed to perform actions from email bodies or static web pages.

```html
<html>
<head><title>Sample approval request</title></head>
<body></body>
<script>
var secret = ""
var taskId = ""
var customerName = ""
var template = [
  "<div>",
    '<span>Approve please!</span>',
    '<form action="http://supervisor.theeye.io/job/secret/' + secret + '" method=POST>',
      '<input type="hidden" name="customer" value="' + customerName + '">',
      '<input type="hidden" name="task" value="' + taskId + '">',
      '<input type="hidden" name="task_arguments[]" value="arg1">',
      '<input type="hidden" name="task_arguments[]" value="arg2">',
      '<input type="submit" value="ACEPTO">',
    '</form>',
  '</div>',
].join("")

document.body.innerHTML = template

</script>
</html>

```

### **Example 6**
### API integration tokens

Integration Tokens can be obtained only by admin users.

<h2 style="color:red"> Integration Tokens has full admin privileges. Keep it safe</h2>

Accessing to the web interfaz *Menu > Settings > Credentials > Integration Tokens*.


```bash
task_id=$TASK_ID
access_token=$ACCESS_TOKEN
customer=$(echo $THEEYE_ORGANIZATION_NAME | jq -r '.')


curl -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"task_arguments\":[]}" \
  "https://supervisor.theeye.io/job?access_token=${access_token}&customer=${customer}&task=${task_id}"

```

The API response is a the created job. We can save the job id and use it later to query the job status.
